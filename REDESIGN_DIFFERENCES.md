## 1. TL;DR

### 1a. Differences

Where the doc and the code diverge but both build the feature. The **Decision**
column records items we've adjudicated (which side to keep); `—` = not yet
decided. Items the redesign lists but the code does **not** build live in §1b.

| # | Topic | Redesign says | Implementation does | Severity | Decision |
|---|-------|---------------|---------------------|----------|----------|
| A | Auth tables | `core.session`, `core.oauth_identity`, `core.oauth_flow` live in `core` | Separate `auth` schema (better-auth shaped): `auth.users/sessions/accounts/device_authorization/verifications`; `auth.users.id == core.principal.id` | **Major** | **Keep current** (see §2.A) |
| B | Tree provisioning / private areas | V1 provisions **no** structure; magic private paths **deferred**; creator gets `owner@root` | Reserved roots `home.<member_id>` (`~` sugar) + `share` (`SHARE_NAMESPACE`); creator gets `admin` + `owner@home` + `owner@share` (**not** `owner@root`); bare create defaults to `share` | **Major** | **Keep current** (UX; see §2.B) |
| D | Access function | `core.effective_tree_access(_space_id, _principal_id)` → `returns table(tree_path, access)` | `core.build_tree_access(_member_id, _space_id)` → `returns jsonb` | Naming | **Keep current** (see §3.D) |
| E | API endpoints | A single JSON-RPC API (implied) | **Two** endpoints: `/api/v1/memory/rpc` + `/api/v1/user/rpc`, plus REST `/api/v1/auth/*` | Naming/shape | **Keep current** (see §3.E) |
| H | User group listing | `me user group list <user>` (the one `me user` command) | `me group mine` lists your own groups (`whoami` + `group.listForMember`); no `me user` CLI for another user (the RPC already allows it for a space admin) | Partial | **Keep current** — `me group mine` serves the common (self) case; the `me user` surface stays deferred (admins can use the RPC for others) |

### 1b. Not implemented (gaps vs. the redesign)

Listed in the redesign but not built. Detail in §4.

| # | Topic | Redesign wants | Status |
|---|-------|----------------|--------|
| C | Embedding config | Per-space model/dimension, recorded in `core.space` | Not implemented (hardcoded uniform; templated DDL only) |
| G | `me memory copy`/`cp` | Listed in §"Memory Commands" | Not implemented |

(Item **F**, the last-admin safeguard, was previously listed here — now
**implemented**; see §6. Item **H**, user group listing, moved to §1a — it's
partly built via `me group mine`.)

The agent access-masking model (the part the doc was least confident about) **is**
implemented as designed — see §6.

---

## 2. Architectural divergences

### A. Auth lives in a separate `auth` schema, not in `core` — decision: **keep the current implementation**

The redesign places all authentication state in `core`: `core.session`,
`core.oauth_identity`, `core.oauth_flow`. The implementation instead uses a
dedicated **`auth` schema** shaped like better-auth, and `core` contains no auth
tables at all.

Actual `auth` schema (`packages/database/auth/migrate/incremental/`):

- `auth.users` (`001_users.sql:5`) — `id, name, email, email_verified, image, created_at, updated_at`. **`auth.users.id == core.principal.id`** for user principals.
- `auth.accounts` (`002_accounts.sql:8`) — OAuth provider links (`provider_id` ∈ {google, github}, tokens, scope). This is the redesign's `oauth_identity`.
- `auth.sessions` (`003_sessions.sql:10`) — `token_hash` (sha256), `expires_at`, `ip_address`, `user_agent`. This is the redesign's `session`.
- `auth.device_authorization` (`004_device_authorization.sql:7`) — device-code flow state. This is the redesign's `oauth_flow`.
- `auth.verifications` (`005_verifications.sql:7`) — present for better-auth shape parity.

Net effect: the "authorization boundary lives entirely in `core`" framing in the
redesign (§"Authorization Boundary") is true for *authorization* (principals,
grants, groups) but **not** for *authentication* — authentication is its own
schema. The redesign never mentions an `auth` schema or better-auth.

After evaluating the two, **keep the separate `auth` schema** and update
REDESIGN.md to describe it (per §7). Reasoning:

- **Separation of concerns is real.** Authn (sessions, OAuth secrets, device
  codes, PKCE, verification, expiry sweeps) and authz (the grant graph) have
  different security surfaces and change cadences. Intermingling token/secret
  tables with the grant graph — which every group/membership migration touches —
  is exactly what you want to avoid, and it's consistent with the design's own
  clean authz boundary (the `_tree_access` seam).
- **An established auth *shape* beats greenfield SQL auth.** The redesign's
  `core.oauth_flow`/`oauth_identity`/`session` are underspecified, hand-rolled
  auth. Mirroring better-auth's vetted model (account linking, multi-provider,
  verification, session lifecycle) is lower-risk and leaves a credible path to
  adopt the library or a managed service later.
- **The shared-id pattern neutralizes the redesign's main edge.**
  `auth.users.id == core.principal.id` is the standard "identity table ↔ domain
  entity share a PK" pattern: no mapping table, no meaningful duplication — two
  concern-specific rows under one id, written atomically by `provisionUser`
  (`packages/server/provision.ts:80,89`). You keep ~all the simplicity of "one
  identity" while keeping the boundary.
- **Preserves optionality.** The deliberate absence of a cross-schema FK keeps
  `auth` splittable onto its own DB/service later (`packages/database/index.ts`
  notes it could be "distributed across databases again").

Caveats (cost of this choice):

- It follows better-auth's **shape**, not the library — `packages/auth` depends
  only on `@memory.build/database` + `postgres`, with deliberate divergences
  (sha256 `token_hash`; a bespoke `device_authorization`). So the win is a vetted
  schema + upgrade path, not free battle-tested code.
- `auth.verifications` is a **dead table** carried for shape parity (never
  written).
- The `auth.users` ⇄ `core.principal` invariant is **app-enforced only** (no DB
  FK). Whether to add one is its own decision — see
  `DECISIONS_FOR_REVIEW.md` → "No cross-schema FK between `core.principal` and
  `auth.users`" (current call: don't, defer to user-deletion / standalone-users).

### B. Reserved tree paths and provisioning are built, not deferred — decision: **keep the current implementation**

This is the largest behavioral divergence. The redesign's V1 scope says (§"Private
Areas", §"me space create"):

- "We should **defer** magic private paths, implicit deny rules, and automatic
  private area behavior."
- "V1 does not provision any out-of-the-box tree organization. A newly created
  space starts with an empty tree."
- "The creating user receives… `owner` access on the **root** tree path."

The implementation instead bakes in two reserved roots and provisions them:

- `home.<member_id>` with `~` as input sugar — `HOME_NAMESPACE` and `homePrefix()`
  in `packages/database/space/path.ts:29,60`. `add_principal_to_space(...)`
  (`core/migrate/idempotent/006_membership.sql`) auto-grants a joining **user**
  `owner` on `home.<id>`.
- `share` — `SHARE_NAMESPACE` in `packages/database/space/path.ts:38`; a bare
  `memory.create` with no `tree` defaults here.
- A space **creator** gets `admin` + `owner@home.<user>` + `owner@share`, and
  **explicitly not `owner@root`** — `packages/server/provision.ts:55` (`addSpaceCreator`).
  This is the opposite of the redesign's "creator gets owner@root."

Functionally these are still ordinary positive ltree grants (no deny rules, no
implicit subtraction), so the redesign's *non-goal* of "no negative access" is
respected. But the **convention layer the redesign deferred is shipped**, and the
creator's grant is `home`+`share` rather than `root`. Any reader of REDESIGN.md
would expect a fresh space to be empty and root-owned; it is neither.

**Decision: keep current — implemented deliberately, for UX.** Multiplayer spaces
need a usable shared/private layout out of the box; making every new space's admin
design an access model from scratch before writing a single memory is poor
onboarding. The redesign itself calls the motivation valid and lists the
shared/private provisioning as a `me space create` **stretch goal** — we chose to
ship it. Importantly it's built the way the redesign *preferred*: ordinary
positive ltree grants over conventional `home`/`share` roots, **not** magic
private-path patterns or implicit deny rules — so the monotonic, no-deny non-goals
still hold (the access evaluator stays a plain ltree-containment check). The one
substantive thing to fold into REDESIGN.md is that the creator gets
`owner@home` + `owner@share` rather than `owner@root` (so a creator doesn't see
other members' homes; as an admin it can self-grant `owner@root` if it wants the
whole tree).

---

## 3. Naming / shape divergences (same concept, different surface)

### D. Access resolution function — decision: **keep the current implementation**

- Redesign: `core.effective_tree_access(_space_id uuid, _principal_id uuid)
  returns table(tree_path ltree, access int4)`.
- Actual: `core.build_tree_access(_member_id uuid, _space_id uuid) returns jsonb`
  (`core/migrate/idempotent/003_tree_access.sql:131`). Differences: **name**,
  **argument order**, takes **`_member_id`** (not `principal_id`), and returns a
  **JSONB array** of `{tree_path, access}` objects rather than a SQL table.

After evaluating the two, the current implementation is **better or equal on
every axis** — so we keep the code and (per §7) treat REDESIGN.md's signature as
the weaker spec to be updated. Reasoning per axis:

- **Parameter `_member_id` (current) > `_principal_id` (redesign) — correctness.**
  Effective access is only ever computed for an *authenticating actor* (a user or
  agent). A group never authenticates and isn't owner-maskable, and
  `build_tree_access` only dispatches `'u'`/`'a'`. `member_id` (the u|a-only
  generated column) encodes that constraint in the signature; the redesign's
  `_principal_id` is looser and wrongly implies a group could be passed.
- **Argument order `(member_id, space_id)` (current) — consistency.** The whole
  helper family is subject-first: `user_tree_access(_user_id, _space_id)`,
  `agent_tree_access(_agent_id, _space_id)`, `member_tree_access(…, _space_id)`
  (`003_tree_access.sql`). The redesign's space-first order would make the public
  entry the lone exception.
- **Return type `jsonb` (current) vs `table` (redesign) — `jsonb` fits this
  architecture; the table form's edge is unrealized.** The set always
  round-trips through the application layer: `build_tree_access` → TS array
  (`packages/engine/core/db.ts:429`), where the app uses it for the **auth gate**
  (`treeAccess.length === 0` → 403, `authenticate-space.ts`) and **owner checks**
  (`rpc/memory/support.ts`), then passes it **back into every space function as a
  jsonb argument** (`sql.json(treeAccess)::jsonb`,
  `packages/engine/space/db.ts:101`; consumed via `jsonb_to_recordset` in
  `space/migrate/idempotent/001_memory.sql:33`). The only advantage of a
  table-returning function — joining it directly in SQL — is never used, because
  nothing computes access purely in-SQL; the app is always in the loop. And it
  would save nothing: postgres.js parses either return shape into the same
  `[{tree_path, access}]` JS array, and the app re-serializes with `sql.json(…)`
  on the way back down regardless. Meanwhile `jsonb` matches the future sharded
  pushdown with **zero refactor**, and the typed/composable layer the redesign
  wanted **already exists internally** as the `*_tree_access` table functions —
  `build_tree_access` is explicitly just the jsonb *bridge* on top of them.
- **Name `build_` vs `effective_` — cosmetic, the only place the redesign reads
  nicer.** "Effective access" is the precise term for net/resolved permissions;
  "build" describes the bridge role (its doc comment: "the bridge … returns …
  the jsonb array shape"). Not worth a rename across SQL + `CLAUDE.md` + TS. If a
  more semantic public name is ever wanted, `effective_tree_access` (returning
  jsonb) is the one thing worth lifting from the redesign.

Per CLAUDE.md the auth gate is "non-empty `build_tree_access`."

### E. Two RPC endpoints, plus REST auth — decision: **keep the current implementation**

The redesign describes "the hosted API server exposes JSON-RPC over HTTPS" as a
single surface. The implementation splits it (`packages/server/router.ts:252`):

- `/api/v1/memory/rpc` — session **or** api-key + required `X-Me-Space`. Hosts
  `memory.*`, `principal.*`, `group.*`, `grant.*`, `invite.*`.
- `/api/v1/user/rpc` — **session only** (api keys rejected here). Hosts `whoami`,
  `agent.*`, `apiKey.*`, `space.*`.
- `/api/v1/auth/*` — REST device-flow endpoints (`device/code`, `device/token`,
  `device/verify`, `device/approve`, `callback/:provider`).

**Decision: keep current.** The split isn't arbitrary — it encodes two orthogonal
policies as endpoint-level invariants:

- **Credential.** `/user/rpc` is session-only — api keys are *rejected*, not just
  unprivileged (`authenticate-user.ts`). So "agents can't manage agents / keys /
  spaces" is **impossible by construction**: an agent can't even reach
  `agent.*` / `apiKey.*` / `space.*`. On a single endpoint this would be a
  per-method "session-only" flag — a privilege-escalation bug waiting for the
  first forgotten flag.
- **Scope.** `/memory/rpc` is space-scoped (required `X-Me-Space`); the
  `/user/rpc` methods are inherently global/pre-space (`space.list` / `space.create`
  can't sit behind a space header).

The REST `/auth/*` routes aren't really a divergence: OAuth device flow + provider
callbacks are redirect/poll/browser-shaped and can't be JSON-RPC methods — the
redesign's "JSON-RPC over HTTPS" simply omitted that auth must be REST. The cost
is two client classes (`createMemoryClient` / `createUserClient`) sharing the same
`protocol` + transport packages — minor. The single-endpoint alternative is
simpler to *document* but weaker: it demotes a structural security boundary to a
per-method flag. So this reads as the doc under-specifying, not a considered
alternative; "JSON-RPC over HTTPS" still describes the data/control plane.

### CLI verb renames (vs. the redesign's command list)

All same-intent, different spelling:

- `me space alter` → **`me space rename`** (`commands/space.ts:212`).
- `me agent group list` → **`me agent groups`** (`commands/agent.ts:161`).
- `me apikey revoke` → **`me apikey delete`/`rm`** (+ a `me apikey get`)
  (`commands/apikey.ts`). The rename aligns with the doc's own "no soft delete /
  hard delete" stance, but the doc text still says `revoke`.
- `me group member add/remove/list` → **`me group add` / `remove`(`rm-member`) /
  `members`** (`commands/group.ts`).

---

## 4. Not yet implemented (gaps vs. the redesign)

- **C. Per-space embedding config + placement metadata.** The redesign (§"Space")
  wants the embedding model/dimension per-space, templated into the DDL, and
  recorded in `core.space`; the space record should also track placement (the
  shard). Built only partway: the DDL **is** templated
  (`embedding halfvec({{embedding_dimensions}})`,
  `space/migrate/incremental/001_memory.sql:10`), but the value is **hardcoded to
  1536 / `text-embedding-3-small` for every space** (`packages/server/config.ts:8`,
  `packages/server/index.ts:212`). `core.space` records neither model/dimension
  (it carries a TODO: `-- we likely need columns for embedding provider, model,
  dimensions`, `core/migrate/incremental/001_space.sql:9`) nor a shard/placement
  column. Consistent with the "no sharding in v1" non-goal, but the per-space
  hooks the redesign called for aren't there yet.
- **G. `me memory copy` / `cp`.** Listed in §"Memory Commands"; `move`/`mv`
  exists, `copy`/`cp` does not (`commands/memory.ts`). The MCP server likewise has
  `me_memory_mv` but no copy tool.
- **Verified-email enforcement on invite acceptance.** The redesign (§`core.space_invitation`)
  wants acceptance to require an OAuth-verified email matching the invitation
  ("possession of an invite link alone should not be sufficient"). Invitations
  are implemented (`invite create/list/revoke`, `redeem_space_invitations`), but
  the verified-email match requirement should be confirmed against
  `009_invitation.sql` / redemption before relying on it.

---

## 5. Implemented beyond the redesign (in code, not in the doc)

- **`me agent add <agent>`** — adds one of your global agents to the active space
  (`commands/agent.ts:134`). The redesign treats agent→space admission as implied
  by `principal_space` but never gives it a command. (Agents are global; they must
  be admitted to a space before they can hold a key/grants there.)
- **Client/version gating.** `X-Client-Version` header check returns HTTP 426
  "Upgrade Required" below `MIN_CLIENT_VERSION` (`server/middleware/client-version.ts`),
  and the migrator rejects an app older than the DB version
  (`database/migrate/kit.ts:334`). The redesign mentions version *tables* for
  compatibility but not a client-version handshake.
- **`core.space.language`** column for the BM25 text-search config
  (`001_space.sql:8`) — per-space text language, not mentioned in the redesign.
- **Extra env vars:** `ME_SESSION_TOKEN` and `ME_NO_KEYCHAIN` (`packages/cli/credentials.ts`,
  `packages/cli/keychain.ts`) beyond the doc's `ME_SERVER`/`ME_API_KEY`/`ME_SPACE`.
- **CLI config split + keychain.** Implemented as `~/.config/me/config.yaml`
  (non-secret, per-server `active_space`) + `credentials.yaml` (0600 secret
  fallback) + OS keychain (macOS `security`, Linux `secret-tool`). The redesign
  only says "store session tokens somewhere… use keychain"; the concrete split is
  an elaboration.
- **Extra CLI surface:** `me serve` (web UI), `me pack`, `me claude` / `me codex`
  / `me gemini` / `me opencode` (install + import), `me completions`, `me version`,
  `me upgrade`. The doc only asks about a few of these.
- **MCP tool set is broader than the doc's list.** Actual tools
  (`packages/cli/mcp/server.ts`): `me_memory_create`, `me_memory_get`,
  `me_memory_search`, `me_memory_update`, `me_memory_delete`,
  `me_memory_delete_tree`, `me_memory_mv`, `me_memory_tree`, `me_memory_import`,
  `me_memory_export`. The redesign's local list omits `create`, `mv`, and
  `delete_tree`, and writes `update|patch` (there is a single `update`, no
  `patch`).
- **Transitive group admin (Model 2)** is implemented (`is_principal_space_admin`,
  `member_groups` in `003_tree_access.sql` / `001_principal_space.sql`): a user in
  an admin-flagged group inherits space admin; agents are excluded. The redesign
  discusses this but the concrete enforcement is in code.

---

## 6. Confirmed matches (the redesign describes reality)

These are worth recording because they are the parts the redesign was least sure
about or most opinionated on, and the code honors them:

- **Agent access runtime capping.** The "stronger interpretation" the redesign
  preferred — an agent's effective access is its configured access (direct +
  group-derived) **intersected with the owner's current effective access at
  runtime** — is implemented in `agent_tree_access` within
  `core/migrate/idempotent/003_tree_access.sql:54` (overlap → more-specific path,
  `least(access)`, then reduce redundant descendants). The doc's "vibe-coded
  sketch" became real SQL. The V1 rules hold: agents can't be space admins
  (`is_principal_space_admin` excludes `kind='a'`), can't be group admins
  (`member_groups` zeroes the admin flag for agents), may be group members, and
  inherited admin from an admin-flagged group does not make an agent an admin.
- **No soft deletes.** No `deleted_at`/`archived_at`/`is_deleted`/`active`
  anywhere; hard deletes via FK `on delete cascade` plus explicit cascade
  functions (`remove_principal_from_space`, etc.). Matches §"Deletion and
  Cascading".
- **Last-admin safeguard** (was item F — now implemented, and stronger than the
  redesign's wording). A space can't be left without an **effective** admin — a
  *user* who is a direct admin **or** a member of an admin-flagged group. The
  `enforce_last_admin` trigger fn (`core/migrate/idempotent/001_principal_space.sql`)
  fires on `core.principal_space` (admin removed/demoted) **and** `core.group_member`
  (member removed from an admin group), and rejects any change leaving zero
  effective admins, raising SQLSTATE `ME001` → `LAST_ADMIN` (`rpc/core-error.ts`).
  It covers every path uniformly — `principal.remove`, the `add_principal_to_space`
  demote, removing the last member of the sole admin group, and FK cascades from
  `delete_principal` (deleting an admin user/group) — and exempts whole-space
  teardown (`delete_space` drops the `space` row first, so the trigger sees it gone
  and skips; the `select … for update` also serializes concurrent removals).
  Checking the *effective* set (not just the `principal_space.admin` flag) closes
  the brick where a space's sole admin is an **empty admin group** — an
  unrecoverable, ungoverned state the flag-only check would have allowed. Matches
  (exceeds) §"Last-Admin Safeguard".
- **Principal model.** `kind ∈ {u,a,g}`, generated `member_id` (u|a), generated
  `user_id`/`agent_id`/`group_id`, agent `owner_id → principal(user_id)`, name
  scoping (users global, agents per-owner, groups per-space). Matches §`core.principal`.
- **`tree_access` ladder** read=1 / write=2 / owner=3, applies to path + all
  descendants, monotonic, no deny table. Matches §`core.tree_access`. CLI verbs
  `grant` / `rm-grant` (no `revoke`) match the doc exactly (`commands/access.ts`).
- **Space schema tables** `<slug>.memory`, `<slug>.embedding_queue`,
  `<slug>.version`, `<slug>.migration`; `embedding_version` on memory; version-aware
  queue with `vt` / `outcome` / `attempts` / `last_error`; temporal `[a,a]` vs
  `[start,end)` convention enforced by check constraint. Matches §"Space" / §`<slug>.*`.
- **Transport & boundaries.** JSON-RPC over HTTP (not WebSockets), no hosted MCP
  server, local **stdio** MCP proxy that forwards through the client package using
  `ME_API_KEY`; `@memory.build/protocol` (Zod) is the contract source of truth and
  both `protocol` and `client` are published (`private: false`). Dependency flow
  protocol → server → client → CLI → MCP holds. Matches §"API, Client, and MCP
  Boundary".
- **`me memory` is optional / top-level.** Both `me memory <cmd>` and `me <cmd>`
  (e.g. `me search`, `me create`) work — answers the doc's open question "Can the
  memory commands be top-level?" with "yes."
- **Auth specifics** the doc implied: GitHub/Google OAuth, device-code flow,
  session + api-key secrets are **sha256** (not argon2), shared `extractBearerToken`
  helper. Matches.

## 7. Doc-hygiene notes for REDESIGN.md

If REDESIGN.md is meant to track reality, these lines are now stale:

- Move `core.session` / `core.oauth_identity` / `core.oauth_flow` out of the
  `core` section and document the separate `auth` schema (better-auth shape) —
  decided to keep the separate schema, see §2.A.
- §"Private Areas" / §"me space create": the `home`/`share`/`~` convention and the
  creator's `owner@home`+`owner@share` (not `owner@root`) grant are shipped, not
  deferred — decided to keep (implemented for UX, see §2.B); promote the
  shared/private provisioning from stretch goal to V1 scope.
- §"Space": `core.space` does not yet carry embedding or placement columns
  (there's a TODO); embedding is hardcoded uniform. Either implement or downgrade
  the prose to "future."
- §"Authorization Boundary": update `effective_tree_access(_space_id,
  _principal_id) returns table` to the real `build_tree_access(_member_id,
  _space_id) returns jsonb` — the current signature is the preferred one (see
  §3.D for the per-axis reasoning); optionally adopt the name `effective_…` while
  keeping the `_member_id` argument and jsonb return.
- Command list: `space alter`→`rename`, `apikey revoke`→`delete`, `agent group
  list`→`agent groups`; add `me agent add`; `me memory copy` and `me user group
  list` are unbuilt; the single-API framing should mention the two RPC endpoints
  + `/api/v1/auth/*` (decided to keep the split — see §3.E).
- The **last-admin safeguard** is now implemented (SQLSTATE `ME001` /
  `LAST_ADMIN`, the `enforce_last_admin` trigger) — keep §"Last-Admin Safeguard"
  and note the trigger-based enforcement + the admin-group-with-no-members edge.
